      <h1>Blogpost 3: Programming Experience</h1>
      <p>I had little to no programming experience prior to joining the HZ. I had one hour of experience in Python and that's about it. </p>
      <p>Before joining the study I did have a lot of knowledge about languages, I knew about compilers, syntax, high-end etc. </p>
      <p>Now after being in the study for almost two months I have a month experience of Javascript</p>
