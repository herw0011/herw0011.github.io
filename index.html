    <h2>Why HBO-ICT suits me</h2>

<p>I am a very big nerd so everything about computers interests me. I did the skc in my third year of secondary school and landed on HBO ICT</p>
<p>I looked at some other courses, but I didn't find anything interesing.</p>
<p>In my exam year I did my PWS about coding and I did a lot of research in the subject. I was very interested and decided to sign up.</p>
<p>The HZ is perfect for me because of the train, I was thinking about going to Breda, but I decided that it would be easier if I just go to the HZ</p>
