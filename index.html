        <p><strong>Why HBO-ICT?</strong></p>
          Because I think technology is cool
          
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
          
          <p>Because I have been surrounded by technology all my life.<br>
            My dad used to be a professional gamer and I have been gaming since I was 5. <br>
            I also think it's cool to design things that have something to do with technology.</p>
        
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p> 
           
          <p>Because I like it when I do/create things that actually work</p>
          
          <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
           
          <p>Because it makes me feel proud off myself.</p>
