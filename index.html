        <h2>Why HBO-ICT suits me</h2>

        <p>I am a very big nerd so everything about computers interests me.
            In primary school I created a website with a friend about the megalodon and I also programmed something
            called 'microbit'. </p>
        <p>I did the skc in my third year of secondary school and landed on HBO ICT.</p>
        <p>I looked at some other courses, but I didn't find anything interesing.</p>
        <p>In my exam year I did my PWS about coding and I did a lot of research in the subject. I was very
            interested in actually learning to code so I decided to sign up.</p>
        <p>The HZ Middelburg is perfect for me because of the train, I was thinking about going to Breda, but I
            decided that it would be easier if I just go to the HZ.</p>
