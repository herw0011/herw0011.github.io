        Why this study?
        <br><br>
        That is the age-old question that everyone asks themselves before they pick any study.
        <br><br>
        I personally picked HBO-ICT because all my life I have been surrounded by technology.
        <br><br>
        Video games, computers and big screens just to name a few. I always wondered how that type of stuff works.
        (Especially video games)
        <br><br>
        In my fifth year of secondary school I did research on coding for my PWS and figured out a lot.
        <br><br>
        I found out about all sorts of different languages, which languages are low-end and which languages are
        high-end.
        <br><br>
        How they have to be compiled so the machine can understand it etc.
        <br><br>
        This was very interestiing to me and I loved the idea of actually doing it, which is a big reason why I decided
        to pick the study.
        <br><br>
        And if I'm being honest, when I found out about the high demand for IT specialists and the money you could make
        I was instantly convinced.
