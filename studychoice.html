    I chose HBO-ICT because I am very into technology. I have been playing games since I was 5 and my dad is a big gamer aswell.
      <br>
      <br>
    In primary school a friend of mine and I created a website about the megladon and also programmed with microbit.
      <br>
      <br> 
    In my third year of secondary school I needed to do my LOB, which meant that I had to pick a study to do research on.
      <br>
      <br>
    I did a studychoicetest and ICT was one of the ones that showed up. In the end I decided to pick it and I found it very interesting.
      <br>
      <br>
    In my fifth year I needed to write my PWS and I wrote mine about different programming languages. 
      <br>
      <br>
    This helped me figure out what programming is and how it works.
      <br>
      <br>
    After writing the PWS I was very certain that HBO-ICT would be the study for me and now that I've been here for almost two weeks I can say that I was correct.
